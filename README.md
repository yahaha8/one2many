bridging gaps in learning and providing real world knowledge 
# One to Many 💡  
*A project to make real learning and real skills accessible to everyone.*

a] Inspiration
Inspired by the book *“One Light, Many Lamps”* — the idea that one spark of knowledge can light up many minds.

b] Mission
To help people (rural and urban) gain **real-world skills** and **understanding**, not just exam-focused knowledge.

c] The Idea
“One to Many” aims to connect learners to mentors, skill paths, and story-based learning modules.  
The goal is to make education feel human, practical, and reachable — even in low-connectivity areas.

d] Current Stage
Still in ideation phase (Idea-a-thon submission).  
Implementation will involve exploring APIs, FastAPI, and possible SMS/web integration.

d] Next Steps
- Prototype API using FastAPI  
- Design storytelling-based learning flow  
- Research SMS delivery or offline-first methods
